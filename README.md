# GenreMIDI: AI-Powered MIDI Pattern Generation by Genre

## Overview

GenreMIDI is an innovative project that leverages advanced machine learning techniques, including Google's Magenta library, to generate MIDI patterns across various musical genres. By utilizing Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), this project aims to create unique and genre-specific musical patterns that can inspire musicians, producers, and composers.

## Features

- MIDI pattern generation for multiple musical genres
- Utilization of Google's Magenta library for advanced music generation
- Genre-specific model training and generation
- Customizable output parameters (e.g., tempo, complexity, pattern length)
- Easy-to-use command-line interface and Python API

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/GenreMIDI.git
   cd GenreMIDI
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Train a model for a specific genre:
   ```
   python train.py --genre jazz --dataset_path /path/to/jazz_midis
   ```

2. Generate MIDI patterns:
   ```
   python generate.py --genre jazz --num_patterns 5 --output_dir ./output
   ```

3. Customize generation parameters:
   ```
   python generate.py --genre rock --num_patterns 3 --tempo 120 --complexity 0.7 --output_dir ./output
   ```

## Supported Genres

- Classical
- Jazz
- Rock
- Electronic
- Hip-Hop
- Folk
- (More genres can be added by training on appropriate datasets)
